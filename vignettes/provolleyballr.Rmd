# Introduction

The `{provolleyballr}` R package provides functions for extracting statistics from [Athletes Unlimited](<https://auprosports.com/volleyball), [League One Volleyball (LOVB)](https://lovb.com) and [Major League Volleyball (MLV)](https://provolleyball.com) websites. This vignette demonstrates how use the functions and included team and player data.

## Available Data

The package includes four main datasets created with the `group_stats()` function: player season data from AU and player season and team match data for LOVB and PVF.

```{r data-overview}
# Load AU individual player data  
head(au_player_data)

# Load LOVB individual player data  
head(lovb_player_data)

# Load LOVB team match data
head(lovb_team_data)

# Load MLV individual player data  
head(mlv_player_data)

# Load MLV team match data
head(mlv_team_data)
```



# Conclusion

This vignette demonstrates various approaches to analyzing PVF data using the **provolleyballr** package. The included datasets provide rich opportunities for:

- Team performance evaluation
- Individual player assessment  
- Role-based analysis
- Statistical modeling and prediction
- Comparative studies across teams and seasons

For more advanced analyses, consider combining this data with external sources or developing custom metrics specific to volleyball analytics.
