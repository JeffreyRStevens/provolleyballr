The [`{provolleyballr}`](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/provolleyballr) R package provides tools for scraping match statistics and player data from the League One Volleyball website <https://lovb.com> and the Pro Volleyball Federation (PVF) website <https://provolleyball.com>.

## Installation

You can install the development version of provolleyballr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/provolleyballr")
```

## System Requirements

This package requires:

- The [`{selenider}`](https://ashbythorpe.github.io/selenider/) R package for web automation
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser installed on your system
- Active internet connection

## Basic Usage

### Load the Package

```{r setup}
library(provolleyballr)
```

### Available Teams

The package includes information about all LOVB and PVF teams:

```{r teams}
# View available teams
lovb_teams
pvf_teams
```

### Scraping Statistics

Use `get_stats()` to retrieve team or individual player statistics from a particular league:

```{r example-team, eval = FALSE}
# Get team match statistics for Omaha Supernovas in 2024
get_stats(league = "LOVB", team = "Austin", year = 2025, level = "team")

# Get individual player statistics
get_stats(league = "PVF", team = "Omaha", year = 2024, level = "player")
```

### Working with Included Datasets

The package includes pre-scraped datasets (using `group_stats()` aggregating function) for analysis that includes all LOVB and PVF team and player data for 2024-2025.

* `lovb_player_data`

* `lovb_team_data`

* `pvf_player_data`

* `pvf_team_data`


For more information, see the package vignette:

```{r vignette-info, eval=FALSE}
# View the analysis vignette
vignette("get-started", package = "provolleyballr")
```
