The [`{provolleyballr}`](https://jeffreyrstevens.github.io/provolleyballr) R package provides tools for scraping match statistics and player data from [Athletes Unlimited](<https://auprosports.com/volleyball), [League One Volleyball (LOVB)](https://lovb.com) and [Major League Volleyball (MLV)](https://provolleyball.com) (formerly the Pro Volleyball Federation) websites.


## Installation

You can install the development version of provolleyballr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JeffreyRStevens/provolleyballr")
```

## System Requirements

This package requires:

- The [`{selenider}`](https://ashbythorpe.github.io/selenider/) R package for web automation
- [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser installed on your system
- Active internet connection

## Basic Usage

### Load the Package

```{r setup}
library(provolleyballr)
```

### Available Teams

The package includes information about all LOVB and MLV teams:

```{r teams}
# View available teams
lovb_teams
mlv_teams
```

### Scraping Statistics

Use `get_stats()` to retrieve team or individual player statistics from a particular league:

```{r example-team}
# Get team match statistics for Omaha Supernovas in 2024
get_stats(league = "LOVB", team = "Omaha", year = 2025, level = "team")

# Get individual player statistics
get_stats(league = "MLV", team = "Omaha", year = 2025, level = "player")
```

Or use the league-specific functions for AU, LOVB, and MLV using `au_stats()`, `lovb_stats()`, and `mlv_stats()` respectively. For player data, AU only needs a year, and LOVB and MLV need the team name and `level = "player"`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
au_stats(year = 2025)
lovb_stats(team = "Omaha", year = 2025, level = "player")
mlv_stats(team = "Omaha", year = 2025, level = "player")
```


To get team data for LOVB and MLV, use `lovb_stats()` and `mlv_stats()` respectively. For both functions, simply include the team name and year and set `level = "team"`.

```{r eval = FALSE}
lovb_stats(team = "Omaha", year = 2025, level = "team")
mlv_stats(team = "Omaha", year = 2025, level = "team")
```


### Available Data

The package includes five main datasets created with the `group_stats()` function using data: player season data from AU (2021-2025) and player season and team match data for AU, LOVB, and MLV (2024-2025).

```{r data-overview}
# Load AU individual player data  
head(au_player_data)

# Load LOVB individual player data  
head(lovb_player_data)

# Load LOVB team match data
head(lovb_team_data)

# Load MLV individual player data  
head(mlv_player_data)

# Load MLV team match data
head(mlv_team_data)
```

These datasets are also directly available for download as CSV files:
* [au_player_data]()
* [lovb_player_data]()
* [lovb_team_data]()
* [mlv_player_data]()
* [mlv_team_data]()
